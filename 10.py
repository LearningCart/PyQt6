# Context Menu
# Context menus are small context-sensitive menus which typically appear 
# when right clicking on a window. Qt has support for generating these menus, 
# and widgets have a specific event used to trigger them.

# In the following example we are going to intercept the .contextMenuEvent a QMainWindow. 
# This event is fired whenever a context menu is about to be shown, and is passed 
# a single value event of type QContextMenuEvent.

# To intercept the event, we simply override the object method with our new method 
# of the same name. So in this case we can create a method on our MainWindow subclass 
# with the name contextMenuEvent and it will receive all events of this type.
