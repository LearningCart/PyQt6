## My excercise files while learning PyQt6

### About
This repository contains all the examples I created on-the fly while learning PyQt6.

### Source:
Most of my learning is based on the resources from:
https://www.pythonguis.com/pyqt6-tutorial/

### TODO
To create full projects utilizing the skills and knowledge., 
Idea 1: 
Arduino ESP32 nano running UDP servver and PyQt6 based GUI will trigger
changes in the system parameter to change physical parameters.

Idea 2:
MatrixEngine?

Idea 3:
Multi-lingual relay control board over UDP/ESP-NOW*

* ESP-NOW* - Need to talk to serially connected ESP32 first which will relay the message to remote Arduino ESP32 Nano

Idea 4:
Bluetooth controlled relay board and UI is in PyQt6.
For accessing BLE, we need BLED v1.2 dongle or we can use BleuIO dongle using pygatt

Idea 5:
BNO085 or similar 9-DoF sensor data visualized through the PyQt6 based UI..,

Idea 6:
Complete tutorial project on using PyQt6 to create embedded system test bench.,
